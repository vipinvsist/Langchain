On fields of green, where willow meets leather,
A ballet of power, in all kinds of weather.
A red cherry gleams, in the bowler's strong hand,
A strategic delivery, across the land.

The pitch, a canvas, for spin and for seam,
A wicketkeeper's watchful and agile dream.
The batsman stands ready, with eyes on the ball,
To drive or to flick, to answer the call.

A flick of the wrist, a boundary so grand,
Four runs or six soaring, across the green sand.
The crowd roars its pleasure, with every good stroke,
As records are broken, and legends are woke.

From Test match endurance, a five-day long fight,
To T20's fast pace, under stadium light.
The spirit of cricket, a gentleman's game,
With passion and skill, fueling its flame.

So here's to the players, the fans, and the cheer,
For the joy that you bring, year after year.
A sport of tradition, of honor and might,
Cricket, you shine, ever so bright.
